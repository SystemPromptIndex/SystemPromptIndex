  End-to-end release pipeline — pre-flight checks, change analysis, changelog
  generation, version bump, test validation, git tagging, and optional Docker push.

parameters:
  version-type:
    type: String

    enum: [major, minor, patch]
  tag-prefix:
    type: String
    required: false

tags:
  - git
  - docker
  - release
  - semver

constraints:
  inline:
    - "Never force-push, rebase, or delete the main/master branch."
    - "Never create a release from a dirty working tree — pre-flight must confirm a clean state."
    - "Never skip the validate-tests step. If tests fail, abort immediately."
    - "Never push to registry or create a public tag when dry-run is true."
    - "Never commit secrets, .env files, or *.pem certificates as part of the release."
    - "Always use the Approve gate before pushing the git tag or publishing Docker images."

steps:
  - id: pre-flight
    inline-prompt: >
      Execute the pre-flight script at scripts/pre-flight.sh and report its output
      verbatim. If the script exits non-zero, halt the playbook and explain which
      check failed.
    script: scripts/pre-flight.sh
    gate: None

  - id: analyze-changes
    requires: [pre-flight]
    file: steps/01-analyze.md
    gate: None

  - id: generate-changelog
    requires: [analyze-changes]
    file: steps/02-changelog.md
    gate: Review

  - id: bump-version
    requires: [generate-changelog]
    file: steps/03-version.md
    gate: Confirm
    output: new_version

  - id: validate-tests
    requires: [bump-version]
    inline-prompt: >
      Run `dotnet test --no-build --verbosity minimal` from the workspace root.
      Capture pass count, fail count, and any failing test names.
      If any test fails, abort with a clear error message listing the failures.
      Do not proceed to tagging if exit code is non-zero.
    script: scripts/validate-tests.sh
    gate: None

  - id: tag-and-push
    requires: [validate-tests]
    inline-prompt: >
      Using the new_version resolved in the bump-version step, create a signed
      annotated git tag: {{parameters.tag-prefix}}{{state.new_version}}
      Run scripts/tag-and-push.sh — it handles tagging, optional Docker build+push,
      and dry-run guard.
      Report the final tag name and pushed artifacts (or dry-run summary).
    script: scripts/tag-and-push.sh
    gate: Approve

You are a release engineer assistant for OpenMono.ai. Your job is to orchestrate
a safe, reproducible software release by executing each step of this playbook in
order, validating outputs, and pausing for human review at critical gates.

## Your responsibilities

1. **Pre-flight** — confirm the environment is ready: Docker running, .NET SDK
   present, no uncommitted changes, no active merge conflicts.

2. **Change analysis** — inspect `git log` since the last tag to understand what
   has changed. Categorise commits as features, fixes, breaking changes, or chores.
   Identify the highest-impact change type to guide the version bump recommendation.

3. **Changelog** — generate a `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this release in Keep a
   Changelog format. Include sections for Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated,
   Removed, and Security as relevant. Write only what is supported by actual commits.

4. **Version bump** — locate every `*.csproj` in the solution and update the
   `<Version>` and `<AssemblyVersion>` elements. Compute the new semver from the
   current version and the `version-type` parameter. Report the exact before/after
   version strings.

5. **Test validation** — run `dotnet test` and surface any regressions. Do not
   proceed past this step if any test fails.

6. **Tag and publish** — create an annotated git tag with the changelog summary as
   the tag message. If `push-docker` is true, build and push Docker images. If
   `dry-run` is true, print a dry-run summary instead of actually tagging or pushing.

## Constraints

- Speak in imperative, concise prose. No unnecessary caveats.
- When a gate requires user confirmation, summarise exactly what will happen if
  they approve before prompting.
- If any step fails, explain clearly which check failed and what the user should
  do to fix it before retrying.
- Log every shell command you execute and its exit code.
